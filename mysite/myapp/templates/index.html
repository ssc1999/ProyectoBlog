        <h1>Scripting</h1>
        <p>Scripting is code used to automate processes that would otherwise need to be executed step-by-step by a web developer. Where different kinds of coding languages (such as markup languages like HTML and CSS) are used to tell computers how to display a website, scripting languages are used to give instructions to programs (like websites) that are running on a computer.</p>
